 Entity management module for (DDAT) Godot Prototyping Framework.
includes ddat-gpf.core v0.1.9

_readme up to date as of version 0.2.6-experimental_

This is to be a collection of wide-use scripts controlling the behaviour of projectile and area of effect entities within Godot games.

Currently this module consists of four submodules:
* **the module core files** _(the actor, entity, and object pooling, classes)_
* **the entity ability system** _(activation and input management, 2d targeting system)_
* **the entity extensions library** _(node creation and object pooling extensions)_
* **the player controller library** _(simple ready-to-go player controllers for your 2d projects)_

Currently this project is at an early stage. An experimental release is provided (download the source and copy the entire /src/ directory into your own root(res://) project directory) but it is only recommended for experienced or curious developers comfortable with an unfinished product. Some parts are unfinished, or only partially working, and I will not be providing support for the current release.
